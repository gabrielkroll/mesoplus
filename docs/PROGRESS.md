## Now

**Slice 7 — Readiness Integration**
Goal: Surface readiness data (sleep/energy/soreness) in the action bar or Summary — connect how the athlete feels to what the app suggests.
Status: Not started — discuss acceptance criteria before touching code.

## Done

| Slice | Commit | Key decisions |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Navigation Refactor | `8e36b7c` | Log→Train, Stats→Summary (placeholder), Analysis→Insights. Nav order: Summary→Train→Insights→Plan→Profile. Old Stats preserved under Profile→Stats. |
| 2 — Summary MVP | `2a0e50a` | Today card (Day X · Full Body · Focus, done ✓/in progress). Week card (gymDone/4, ABCD indicators, days left, urgency). DAY_FOCUS: A/C=Posterior & Biceps, B/D=Quads & Chest. Week = Mon–Sun. |
| 3 — Plan → Train Clarity | `0fdf3f0` | Focus labels on Plan day headers. Activity block header = "Day A · Full Body · Posterior & Biceps" (no duplication). completed flag added to completeDay(). ABCD indicators: faded=pending, grey=in progress, green=done. |
| 4 — Weekly Completion Loop | `d0e013c` | Pull created by ABCD indicators (S2). Summary header: phase name in phase color (serif italic 32px) + microcycle week label (mono). Deselect fix: Summary updates immediately when Train deselected. Active nudge deferred to S6. |
| 5 — Volume Awareness | `1ec753b` | Two cards: sessions (gymDone/4 + ABCD) and sets (actual/planned + pace bar). Planned from TEMPLATES + setGoals. Actual from logged sets. Pace = actual vs (planned/4 × sessions done). Cards data-only — action layer deferred to S6. 44px serif + 13px mono across all cards. |
| 6 — Adaptive Action Bar | `7fd8763` | Full-screen training sheet (full-screen modal, no Complete Day footer). Floating pill action bar (Apple Music pattern): whole pill = open sheet, ··· dot menu = "Wrap up Day X". State machine: not-started / in-progress / done. TODAY card owns session identity, action bar owns state. Shadow removed, 68px mobile gap. DOM ID conflict fix for ex-tbody. |

## Decisions Log

- Branch: `v1-extension` — main stays stable and live
- Nav order confirmed: Summary → Train → Insights → Plan → Profile
- Tab names: Summary, Train, Insights, Plan, Profile
- "Train" over "Log" — action word, clearer mental model
- Stats page preserved under Profile → Stats, not deleted
- One slice = one commit on v1-extension
- Always discuss acceptance criteria before writing code
- Grep before reading — never load index.html whole
- Extra sessions card (BJJ/custom count) — parked, add after S6
- Train tab refactor (activity block → full-screen sheet, shared component) — parked as S11, depends on S6
